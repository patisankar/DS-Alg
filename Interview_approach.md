### coding

1. Start with a concise problem framing (This shows you understand exactly what is being asked.) paraphrasing, not exact words 
   We need determine, city with fewest neighbour cities with given distance threshold. 
2. Identify the core technical requirement(This signals you know the scope of the problem.) constraints
   
3. Present solution options and choose the right one ( This shows you think in terms of trade-offs and constraints.)
4. Describe your algorithm at a high level
5. Highlight key correctness and implementation points(This shows mastery of details that reduce bugs.)
6. Communicate complexity clearly(Your interviewer wants to see that you think about scalability.)
7. While coding, narrate decisions like a senior(This is how seniors communicate while writing code.)
8. Show awareness of edge cases(This demonstrates completeness of thought.)
9. Summarize the design before finishing(Ending on a strong summary helps reinforce leadership-level clarity.)
