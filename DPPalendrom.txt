A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, such as 121 or tacocat. A substring is a continuous sequence of characters within a string. Given a string s, how many unique substrings of s are palindromes?

Example

s = "mokkori"

Some of its substrings are [m, o, k, r, i, mo, ok, mok, okk, kk, okko]. There are 7 distinct palindromes [m, o, k, r, i, kk, okko].

Approach1: went wrong
======================
with recurssion I could get all the sub palendrom sub strings from main string. turn out it is simple idea 
expand around center (odd) , expand around center(even)

Approach2: DP
============
