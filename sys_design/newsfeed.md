**Scalability**: Our proposed system should be highly scalable to support the ever-increasing number of users on any platform, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

**Fault tolerance**: As the system should be handling a large amount of data, therefore, partition tolerance (system availability in the event of network failure between the system’s components) is necessary.

**Availability:** The service must be highly available to keep the users engaged with the platform. The system can compromise strong consistency for availability and fault tolerance, according to the PACELC theorem.

**Low latency:** The system should provide newsfeeds in real-time. Hence, the maximum latency should not be greater than 2 seconds.
